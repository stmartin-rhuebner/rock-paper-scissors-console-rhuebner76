# Rock Paper Scissors (RPS)
The Offical Rules on the [World Rock Paper Scissors Association (WRPSA)](https://wrpsa.com/the-official-rules-of-rock-paper-scissors/) describes the game as is a simple, zero-sum, guessing game typically played by two or more people using only hand guestures. Players choose and make one of a select hand gesture (i.e., Rock, Paper, or Scissors), each having a strength or weakness against another shape, which determines the outcome of the game. 

## Basic Rules 
The rules are simple, players compare guestures after either simultaneously or after secretly selecting a random gesture. When comparing gestures the outcome is determined by these rules:
  * Rock beats Scissors
  * Paper beats Rock
  * Scissors beats Paper

## Program

## Input

- `rock` or `r`
- `paper` or `p`
- `scissors` or `s`
- `quit` or `q`
